fixed country effect vs MLM?

[Fixed country effects:]{.underline}

1.  Treats each country as a separate group or category
2.  Includes a dummy variable for each country
3.  Estimates a separate intercept for each country
4.  Assumes that differences between countries are fixed, non-random
5.  Does not allow for generalizing the findings to a broader population
    of countries

[Multilevel modeling:]{.underline}

1.  Explicitly models the nested structure of the data (individuals
    within countries)
2.  Allows for estimating both individual-level and country-level
    effects
3.  Treats country-level effects as random, drawn from a distribution of
    possible values
4.  Allows for generalizing findings to a broader population of
    countries
5.  Provides estimates of the variance at each level (individual and
    country)

Generally, multilevel modeling is preferred when:

1.  The sample of countries is considered a random sample from a larger
    population of countries, and you want to make inferences about that
    larger population.
2.  You are interested in decomposing the total variance into
    individual-level and country-level components.
3.  You anticipate that the relationship between the individual-level
    independent variable and the dependent variable may vary across
    countries (varying/random slopes).

Fixed country effects might be preferred when:

1.  The countries in your sample are not a random sample
2.  You are primarily interested in estimating the average effect of the
    individual-level independent variable, while controlling for
    country-level differences
3.  The number of countries is relatively small (e.g., less than 10-15)

[When we have both an individual-level and a country-level independent
variable, and we nest observations within countries, **there is a
potential issue with conflating the contributions of the two
variables**]{.underline}**.**

-   In a multilevel model, the country-level random effects (or fixed
    effects) capture all the unobserved characteristics and influences
    at the country level that affect the outcome variable. This includes
    the effect of the country-level independent variable included in the
    model, as well as any other unmeasured country-level factors.

-   So, when nesting observations within countries, we are effectively
    controlling for all country-level influences, observed and
    unobserved. This means that the estimate of the effect of our
    country-level independent variable may be attenuated or even become
    non-significant, because its effect is being partially or fully
    absorbed by the country-level random (or fixed) effects.

-   Can be addressed by [including an interaction between the
    individual-level and country-level independent
    variables]{.underline}. This allows the effect of the
    individual-level variable to vary across countries, and helps
    separate the contributions of the two variables.

So, how do I make sense that CTL was a significant separate factor in
fixed country effect but not in MLM? -\> *if CTL varies primarily
between countries, then the country fixed/random effects will capture
nearly the same source of variation in the outcome.*

1.  [Over-controlling for country differences:]{.underline} As we
    discussed earlier, the country-level random effects may be absorbing
    some of the true effect of the country-level predictor, leading to
    an underestimated effect in the multilevel model. This is an example
    of cross-level bias.

2.  [Confounding country-level variables]{.underline}: The fixed effects
    model may be confounded by unobserved country-level factors. The
    multilevel model accounts for this through the random effects,
    thereby reducing confounding bias and weakening the significance of
    the country predictor.

3.  [Model dependency:]{.underline} The significance can be sensitive to
    whether [other covariates]{.underline} are included in the model.
    Different sets of controls may change the estimate and significance.

# model 1 means that, the baseline level (support from men) can vary across different countries. It acknowledges that there may be unobserved or unmeasured factors specific to each country that influence capital punishment support. The model accounts for this variability between countries and allows for more accurate estimation of the effect of gender on capital punishment support while controlling for country-level differences.This only finds, on average, how different women are.

The error about "singularities" in the fixed effects model - [this often
occurs when **predictors are collinear**]{.underline}

it is quite possible that the CTL variable, as a measure of cultural
tightness-looseness at the country level, [**is primarily just capturing
inherent differences between countries**]{.underline}. There are a few
reasons why this may be the case:

-   Tightness-looseness is conceptualized as a [cultural
    characteristic]{.underline} that varies between societies and
    countries. So the CTL measure was designed specifically to capture
    country/society-level differences in this cultural dimension.

-   Countries likely differ on a whole host of historical, contextual,
    and compositional factors that shape their level of cultural
    tightness-looseness. The CTL variable summarizes all of these
    complex country differences into a single cultural dimension.

-   If tightness-looseness is fairly stable within countries over time,
    then CTL won't show much variation except between countries. This
    could make it *highly collinear* with country fixed effects in a
    regression model.

# an explanation of "int" type: A shortcut for marginal effects plots, where interaction terms are automatically detected and used as terms-argument. Furthermore, if the moderator variable (the second - and third - term in an interaction) is continuous, type = "int" automatically chooses useful values based on the mdrt.values-argument, which are passed to terms. Then, ggpredict is called. type = "int" plots the interaction term that appears first in the formula along the x-axis, while the second (and possibly third) variable in an interaction is used as grouping factor(s) (moderating variable). Use type = "pred" or type = "eff" and specify a certain order in the terms-argument to indicate which variable(s) should be used as moderator. See also this package-vignette
